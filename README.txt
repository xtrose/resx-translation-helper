If you develop apps for Windows or Windows Mobile yourself, you know how expensive it is to translate resx files.

This tool will help you do this.
The resx translation assistant breaks down the resx file into your strings and prepares it for translation with the Bing Translator or Google Translator.
The result translated online is then converted back to a resx file via the app.
With this tool, we translated all our Windows and Windows Mobile apps, automatically, into more than 30 languages. And this in less than 2 hours of working time.
It is available free of charge.

Application:
- Read the resxfile with this app.
- Translate the processed text online with the Bing Translator or Google Translator.
- Read the translation with the app and speak it your translated resx file.
